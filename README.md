## End of Task Summary
- Current project health: Early-stage planning is solid; core principles and MVP boundaries are documented, but implementation specs are still incomplete.
- Immediate next actions: Finalize org creation path, delay policy, and external email scope; complete email pipeline, command grammar, and template specs.
- Key risks: Scope creep into web UI or dashboards, inconsistent async timing behavior, and unclear email command authentication.
- Confidence level (low / medium / high): Medium
- Cycle 5: Reviewed demo confirmation outputs against templates and logged mismatches.
- Cycle 7: Updated demo loop outputs to match confirmation/reply templates and thread continuity logging; captured run highlights in employee output.
