We are building an email-first system where users create organizations and hire AI coworkers that behave like real remote employees and communicate only through email threads. There is no chat, no real-time presence, and no productivity gamification—email is the interface and async work is the feature. AI coworkers are intentionally imperfect, slow, and human-like: they ask questions, make assumptions, and coordinate by looping others in, not by instant replies. The goal is to reduce cognitive overload, replace constant pings with thoughtful async collaboration, and make AI feel like coworkers you manage—not tools you command.
