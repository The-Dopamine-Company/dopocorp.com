# Product Principles

1. Email is the UI
   If it doesn't work in email, it doesn't exist.

2. Async by default
   Delays are a feature, not a bug.

3. Imperfection > Intelligence
   AI coworkers should ask dumb questions sometimes.

4. Visibility through work, not status
   No "online", no typing indicators, no green dots.

5. Boring is good
   This should feel like Outlook, not a startup dashboard.
