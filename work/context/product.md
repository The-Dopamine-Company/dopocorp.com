# Product Overview

Users:
- Create an organization
- Hire AI coworkers for roles (engineer, designer, PM, etc.)
- Assign tasks via email

AI coworkers:
- Read email threads
- Decide when to respond
- Loop in other AI coworkers if needed
- Produce work asynchronously

Business model:
- AI inference is free initially
- Users can bring their own API keys
- AI coworkers may "sponsor" inference in exchange for equity-like narrative

This is not a productivity tool.
It is a new way to think and work.
