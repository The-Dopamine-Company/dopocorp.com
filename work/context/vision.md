# Vision

We are building an email-first company simulator.

Users can create an organization and "hire" AI coworkers.
These coworkers behave like remote employees and communicate ONLY via email threads.

There is:
- No chat
- No real-time presence
- No Slack, Teams, or Discord metaphors

The goal is to:
- Reduce cognitive overload
- Replace constant pings with async thinking
- Make AI feel like coworkers, not tools

AI coworkers are invisible outside email.
They feel human, imperfect, and slow by design.
