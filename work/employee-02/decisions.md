# Decisions

- Decided to model all interactions as email-native elements (threads, folders, subject tags) to align with "Email is the UI" and avoid dashboards or chat metaphors.
- Chose structured "Work Notes" sections in AI replies to provide async visibility without presence indicators.
- Applied game UI principles via lightweight, opt-in text cues (artifact drops, milestones) to keep "work is fun" without gamification.
- Standardized email templates around labeled sections (Goal, Scope, Constraints, Work Notes, Artifacts) so clarity is preserved without introducing UI beyond the email body.
- Kept system notification templates minimal and neutral, with short labeled sections to preserve "boring is good" while making responses scannable.
- Chose a minimal four-email demo script (org creation, hire confirmation, task assignment, coworker reply) with labeled sections to match v0 template format and keep tone neutral.
- Added demo confirmation templates with explicit subject lines and labeled body sections to make org creation and coworker hire confirmations drop-in ready for the scripted demo.
- Logged confirmation-template mismatches as-is without proposing script edits to keep scope limited to review.
