# Decisions

- Decided to model all interactions as email-native elements (threads, folders, subject tags) to align with "Email is the UI" and avoid dashboards or chat metaphors.
- Chose structured "Work Notes" sections in AI replies to provide async visibility without presence indicators.
- Applied game UI principles via lightweight, opt-in text cues (artifact drops, milestones) to keep "work is fun" without gamification.
