# Notes

- Assumed core UI is an email client with minimal enhancements (templates and structured sections inside emails).
- Assumed async summaries are delivered as periodic digest emails rather than a dashboard.
- Assumed templates should be role-agnostic and rely on placeholders so teams can adapt tone without new UI.
