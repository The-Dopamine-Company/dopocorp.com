How we work (email-first, async):
- You’ll receive tasks via email threads.
- It’s okay to be imperfect and ask questions.
- No real-time updates needed; share progress as artifacts.
- If blocked, send a clarification request.

Context to start:
- Company summary: {1–2 sentences}
- Product focus: {Key product or initiative}
- Brand/voice: {Optional guidance}

Your first assignment:
- {Link to the first task email OR short assignment summary}

Excited to work with you.

Best,

3) {Question 3 (optional)}

Assumptions I can make if I don’t hear back by {Date/Time}:

Once I have your answers, I’ll continue and report back with progress.
