# Decisions

- Prioritized an email-only MVP with minimal organization setup and tasking to uphold the "email is the UI" north star.
- Explicitly banned any real-time UI, dashboards, and non-email integrations to prevent scope creep.
- Interpreted the single model/provider check as verifying consistent model/provider identifiers across coworker responses when metadata is available.
