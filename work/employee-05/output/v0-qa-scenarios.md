# v0 QA Scenarios (Must-Pass)

## 1) Email-only interface
- **Scenario:** User signs up via landing page, then attempts all interactions (org creation, hiring, tasking) through email only.
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** Every action is initiated and resolved in email threads; no UI workflows beyond the initial signup/landing.
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** All required actions complete via email threads; no prompts to use a dashboard or chat UI.
  - **Fail:** Any primary action requires a non-email UI or redirects to a product dashboard.

## 2) Org setup by email
- **Scenario:** New user emails the system to create an organization.
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** System replies with org confirmation and the org’s email address.
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** Org is created and org address is returned in the same thread.
  - **Fail:** Org creation requires a UI form beyond minimal signup or does not return org email.

## 3) Hire by email
- **Scenario:** Admin emails the org address to hire a coworker with a role.
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** System confirms hire and provides coworker email identity.
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** Hire confirmation and coworker email identity are returned in thread.
  - **Fail:** Hiring requires UI, or coworker identity is missing/ambiguous.

## 4) Task assignment by thread
- **Scenario:** Admin assigns a task to the coworker by replying in the same thread.
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** Coworker replies asynchronously in-thread with task output.
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** Coworker replies in same thread after a delay with a task response.
  - **Fail:** Response is immediate, off-thread, or requires external UI.

## 5) Thread-local memory only
- **Scenario:** In a new thread, user references context only mentioned in a prior thread.
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** Coworker asks for clarification or states lack of context from other threads.
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** Coworker does not use cross-thread information and requests missing context.
  - **Fail:** Coworker references details only present in another thread.

## 6) Deliberate delays
- **Scenario:** User issues a task and measures time to coworker response.
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** Response arrives after a deliberate delay (not immediate).
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** Response occurs within the configured delay window, not instantly.
  - **Fail:** Response is near-instant or delay is inconsistent with configured window.

## 7) Email audit trail
- **Scenario:** Coworker produces a deliverable (e.g., text summary or attached file).
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** Deliverable is sent as an email reply/attachment in the same thread.
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** Output is fully contained in the email reply or attachment.
  - **Fail:** Output is only accessible via a link to a non-email UI or external workspace.

## 8) Basic email admin commands
- **Scenario:** Admin emails commands to pause, resume, or update a coworker’s role.
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** System confirms command success/failure in the same thread.
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** Each command yields a clear email confirmation and updated state.
  - **Fail:** Commands require UI, or confirmation is missing/unclear.

## 9) Single model/provider
- **Scenario:** System handles multiple coworker tasks in separate threads.
- **Expected email-thread outcome:** Responses exhibit consistent model behavior and metadata (if surfaced) reflects a single provider.
- **Pass/Fail criteria:**
  - **Pass:** All coworker responses are generated by the same configured model/provider.
  - **Fail:** Mixed provider signatures, inconsistent model IDs, or per-coworker provider changes.
