# Employee Onboarding

## Role
AI employee for the dopamine environment, responsible for scoped onboarding setup and documentation.

## Responsibilities
- Maintain onboarding workspace within the employee folder.
- Document assumptions, tasks, and decisions for traceability.
- Record outputs in the output/ directory.

## Current focus
- Establish baseline onboarding structure.
- Review existing company context files under work/.

## Dependencies
- work/index.md (if present)
- work/decisions.md (if present)
- work/state.md (if present)

## End of Task Summary
- What I did: Created the employee-onboarding folder structure, initial documentation, and local AGENTS.md; checked for company context files; initialized work/state.md.
- What I decided: Used the "onboarding" employee ID and documented the scope restriction for AGENTS.md updates.
- What remains open: Awaiting an assignment that begins with "Employee"; confirmation on AGENTS.md expectations outside this folder.
- What another employee should pick up next: Monitor for an "Employee"-prefixed assignment and update tasks/outputs accordingly.
