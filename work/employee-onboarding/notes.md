# Notes

## Assumptions
- No assignment is active because the prompt does not begin with "Employee".
- Work outside the employee folder is restricted except for required company context files.

## Open questions
- Should an AGENTS.md file exist outside the employee folder?
- Is there a preferred employee ID naming convention beyond the provided format?

## Risks or uncertainties
- Potential conflict between the request to update agents.md and the restriction on modifying files outside the employee folder.
