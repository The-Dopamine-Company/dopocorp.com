Employee 01 — Founding Engineer
Implement (or stub) a runnable demo loop using mocked email transport and in-memory storage. The demo must cover: create org → hire coworker → send task email → schedule delayed reply → send reply in same thread. Output a short implementation note and how-to-run steps to `work/employee-01/output/demo-implementation-notes.md`.

Employee 02 — Product Designer
Provide a ready-to-use set of demo emails (subjects + bodies) for org creation, coworker hire, task assignment, and the coworker reply formatted per v0 templates. Output to `work/employee-02/output/demo-email-scripts.md`.

Employee 03 — AI Coworker Behavior Lead
Write a concrete coworker reply prompt template that produces the required response format (subject prefix + Work Notes + signature) for the demo. Include a sample filled-out reply for the demo task email. Output to `work/employee-03/output/demo-reply-prompt.md`.

Employee 04 — Email System Engineer
Define a minimal mocked email transport + scheduler design for the demo (in-memory queue, delay timer, thread linkage). Include required payload fields and suggested local dev wiring. Output to `work/employee-04/output/demo-mock-transport.md`.

Employee 05 — MVP Scope Police
Write a demo acceptance checklist tailored to the mocked transport path, including explicit pass/fail criteria and any red-line scope violations to avoid. Output to `work/employee-05/output/demo-acceptance-checklist.md`.

Employee onboarding — Onboarding
Verify that each employee folder has the new demo-related output file requested this cycle and list any gaps. Output to `work/employee-onboarding/output/cycle-2-folder-audit.md`.
