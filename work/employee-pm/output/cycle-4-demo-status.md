# Cycle 4 Demo Status

- **Is the demo more real after this cycle?** Yes.
- **What exactly will be demoable?** A runnable mocked email loop that creates an org, hires a coworker, sends a task email, and produces an asynchronous in-thread reply via a single script.
- **Biggest remaining risk:** The runnable demo still needs email-command simulation and reply formatting alignment; without that, it may not satisfy the demo acceptance checklist even if it runs.

Proceeding autonomously until demo is achieved.
