Employee 01 — Founding Engineer
Update the runnable demo script to simulate email command ingestion for org creation and coworker hire, align the coworker reply format with the v0 template (Work Notes + signature), and add clear console logs for each acceptance checklist step. Keep it runnable with in-memory storage and mocked transport only.

Employee 02 — Product Designer
Provide final demo-ready subject/body templates for org creation and coworker hire confirmations that the demo script can embed directly (keep neutral tone and labeled sections).

Employee 03 — AI Coworker Behavior Lead
Provide a concise, demo-ready reply body template that matches the v0 response format (Work Notes + Questions + signature) so it can be inserted verbatim into the demo script.

Employee 04 — Email System Engineer
Review the updated demo loop requirements and specify the minimal thread/header fields that should be printed/logged to demonstrate thread continuity in the mocked transport.

Employee 05 — MVP Scope Police
Run a desk-check against the updated demo design (not code) using the demo acceptance checklist and list any gaps that would prevent a PASS.
