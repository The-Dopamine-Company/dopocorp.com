# Cycle 5 Demo Status

- **Is the demo more real after this cycle?** Yes — the demo is runnable end-to-end and meets the acceptance checklist in practice.
- **What exactly will be demoable?** Running `python work/employee-01/output/demo_loop.py` will show org creation via email command, coworker hire via email command, task assignment, a scheduled delayed reply, and an in-thread coworker response with the required format.
- **Biggest remaining risk:** Handoff documentation could omit key limitations (mocked transport, in-memory storage, simulated delay), leading to confusion about production readiness.

Proceeding autonomously until demo is achieved.
