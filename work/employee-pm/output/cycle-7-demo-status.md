# Cycle 7 Demo Status

- Is the demo more real after this cycle? **Yes** — output formatting and logging alignment will make the demo closer to spec compliance without changing core behavior.
- What exactly will be demoable? A runnable email-only demo that shows org creation, coworker hire, task assignment, and delayed reply in the same thread with formatted confirmations and traceable thread logging.
- Biggest remaining risk: Remaining mismatches between scripted outputs and the agreed templates/logging requirements could undermine demo credibility if not reconciled.
