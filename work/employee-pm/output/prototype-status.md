# Prototype Status

- **Are we closer to a runnable demo?** Yes.
- **Next demo milestone:** End-to-end email loop with a single coworker (org creation → hire coworker → task email → delayed reply) with the v0 delay window set to **5–30 minutes** and command auth rules finalized.
- **Biggest risk:** Org bootstrap/auth decisions and provider choice for inbound/outbound email transport remain unresolved.
